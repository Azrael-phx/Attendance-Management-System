# Attendance-Management-System
Attendance management system using Face Recognition

This project involves building an attendance system which utilizes facial recognition to mark the presence, time-in, and time-out of employees. It covers areas such as facial detection, alignment, and recognition, along with the development of a web application to cater to various use cases of the system such as registration of new employees, addition of photos to the training dataset etc.
This project intends to serve as an efficient substitute for traditional manual attendance systems. It can be used in corporate offices, schools, and organizations where security is essential.

### Technologies Used 

1. Python - Backend
2. Django - Python based framework for Frontend
3. Html 
4. CSS
5. Javascript
6. Bootstrap
7. Github
8. MySQL - Database

## Scope of the Project 

Facial recognition is becoming more prominent in our society. It has made major progress in the field of security. It is a very effective tool that can help low enforcers to recognize criminals and software companies are leveraging the technology to help users access the technology. This technology can be further developed to be used in other avenues such as ATMs, accessing confidential files, or other sensitive materials. This project servers as a foundation for future projects based on facial detection and recognition. This project also convers web development and database management with a user-friendly UI. Using this system any corporate offices, school and organization can replace their traditional way of maintaining attendance of the employees and can also generate their availability(presence) report throughout the month.

The system mainly works around 2 types of users

1. Employee
2. Admin

• Login
• Mark his/her time-in and time-out by scanning their face
• Register himself/herself into the database

## FACE DETECTION :

1. Haarcaascade Frontal face algorithm
2. SVM machine Learning ALgorithm
3. Caffe Model for PreProcessing and Embedding
